# Lotide

A mini clone of the [Lodash](https://lodash.com) library.

## Purpose

**_BEWARE_ : This library was published for learning purposes. It is _not_ intended for use in production-grade software.**

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs.
